## Project Instructions

This repo is your starter code for the project. It is the same as the starter
code we began with in lesson 2. Install and configure Webpack just as we did in
the course. Feel free to refer to the course repo as you build this one, and
remember to make frequent commits and to create and merge branches as necessary!

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
